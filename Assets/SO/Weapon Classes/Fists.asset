  shortDescription: 'No weapons needed just use your fist.

    Probably not the
    best option for fighting monsters.'
  longDescription: 'Probably one of the most well known classes of fighting the humble
    Fists was most likely the first ever recorded form of combat.


    Often used
    as a last resort, Fists are the most convinent form of fighting as they are always
    at the ready they are however not the best at it in terms of damage or self untilities
    as such is often recomended to first find some other weapon.'
