  longDescription: 'Being the main healers of the Church, The Light Mage are one
    of the few schools of healing that can heal freshing chopped limbs. A majority
    of Light Mages are in fact priests of the church providing prayers as they provide
    their services to those in need. The utilize the energy provided by light sources
    in order to repair or reconstruct tissues in the body. Because of this, healers
    that study under this school were called Light Mages. The one downside to a Light
    Mages methods of healing is that they require a significant amount of light or
    direct light from the sun in order to be affective. Additionally, rooms with
    Light Mages inside stangely become darker with one libarary getting renamed to
    The Library of Darkness due to it being filled with Light Mages doing research.


    Light
    Mages come with some healing spells in addition to damage spells. Good for those
    who are low on healing potions while have a significant excess of mana potions
    as the healing spells are quite costly. Furthermore Light Mages are not known
    for their damage out with the one exception of a spell that can knock back enemies
    from its origin.'
