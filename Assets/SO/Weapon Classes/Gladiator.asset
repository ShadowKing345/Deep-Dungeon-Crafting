  shortDescription: Always protecting the innocent. Except when I am doing other
    things.
  longDescription: 'Histories theorise that the first ever shield was made from wood
    bark that has been ripped off of a tree. While this has yet to be proven what
    is fact is that a Galdiator is defensless without one.


    Employed primarily
    by the church as foot soldiers. Gladiators are commonly know as the best form
    of defense in the cities they are stationed in. Strong, dashing, and loyal, Gladiators
    are loved by all up untill they find out that due to certain oaths they have
    taken they cannot be called for some "personal service" to which they are appriciated
    instead. Gladiators are also well known to be in a constant battle with their
    employers in the church, fighting over their value in the higharchy of the church.


    With
    a decent mixture of close range and long range attacks, and very story defenses
    in all forms, Galdiators are good begining class for those first attempting the
    hero life. The one issue Gladiators have is that they lack any form of self healing
    and so carry a lot of healing potions for solo journies or employ a healer for
    party missions.'
