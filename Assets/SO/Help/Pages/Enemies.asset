  description: 'The thing you will most definatly be fighting. Enemies are entities,
    living or just animate objects, that are found within the floors of this Dungeon.
    They are what you have to fight in order to escape as the rooms will lock themselves
    if you walk into a room full of enemies. Furthermore, the materials they drop
    are what is commonly used to craft better gear, weapons and potions.


    Tip:

    Don''t
    let them group up. They are very dangerous combined. In some cases they can take
    out 3/4 of your health all at once.'
