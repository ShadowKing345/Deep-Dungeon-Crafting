  description: 'Floors are the different levels (omg the pun) of the game world.
    They are a collection of 10 floors starting from the 0th going up to the 9th.
    Progressing through them is key to escaping the dungeon.


    Navigating theses
    floor however is not as easy as it seems. To begin with the floors re-arange
    themselves resulting in the layout changing every time. However, a collection
    of floors do follow a given set of rules making them somewhat predictable.


    In
    some cases the exit to the next floor will appear right next to the entrance.
    While this is amazing for speed runners of the game, it is highly unrecomended
    for individuals wishing to progress as you may loose potentially useful mateirals
    that can help you down the line.'
