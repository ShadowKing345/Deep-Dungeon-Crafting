  description: 'Combat is a simple affair to understand.

    You and enemies do
    damage based on elements and attack types.

    You and enemies have resistances
    to certain elements and attack types based on buffs and armor as well as natural
    resistances.


    Damage is calculated based on how strong or week any entity
    is to the perticular attack. Additionally, there is a chance for the attack to
    do critical damage which makes the attack do double damage.


    Abilities:

    Abilities
    are how you do damage, heal or buff yourself or your targets. Each ability has
    a cooldown, cost of mana and the potencies which it uses. An attack is executed
    at the end of the attack animation. Some abilities cast projectiles which are
    ranged attacks that will do damage when they hit an object or entity.


    Buffs:

    Buffs
    or status effects are enhancements to you or enemies. They can either be offensive
    or defensive, helpful or harmful to the entity that is inflicted with them.


    There
    are two kinds of buffs. Static buffs which are buffs that only affect your abilities
    and Ticking buffs which can either harm you in the case of posions or heal you
    in the case of regenerative spells.


    Classes:

    Classes are different
    styles of playing the game. A class can be changed simply by equiping a weapon
    that is used by them. For example, swords and shield are used by Gladiators while
    a Cane is used by Holy Mages (Not fully implemented yet). When no weapon is eqiped
    you use your fists which while not recommended for the higher levels does allow
    you to recover what was lost in lower stages.


    Some classes have advantages
    in certain floors or towards certain enemies but no floor should be unclearable
    with a class. It will just take longer and will be difficult.'
